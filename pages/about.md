# Hi! I'm Ryan. :wave:

I'm a data scientist who uses data for social good.

Right now, I do that as the Director of Strategy & Operations for the Delaware Data Innovation Lab (DDIL) at [Tech Impact](https://techimpact.org/). We partner with mission driven organizations - primarily state agencies and nonprofits - to help them more effectively serve their communities. 

Our work is often focused on the equitable distribution of resources - we make sure that the right people get the right resource at the right time. In my current role, I focus on building partnerships with organizations that need our services. I do everything that is needed to support our team of technologists (whether they are a data scientist, front end developer, or XR engineer).

I'm passionate about the intersection of data science and education. I started my career as a high school math teacher through [Teach for America](https://www.teachforamerica.org/). I believe that many students would be better served by experiencing a math curriculum that is rooted in statistical reasoning. I volunteer time with the [Delaware Math Coalition](https://delawaremathcoalition.org/) to advocate for these changes. I also teach [Foundations of R for Data Analysis](https://www.pcs.udel.edu/foundations-of-r/) through the University of Delaware where I focus on bringing R to more adult learners.

Outside of work I spend most of my time with my wife, daughter, and "miniature" goldendoodle, Jambo. I love a good board game (current favorite game is Terraforming Mars), attempting to woodwork (slowly building out a shop!), and love to travel (from Zion to Zanzibar).
